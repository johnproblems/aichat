# Task 3.3: Dynamic Pricing Engine

## Description
Implement base rate multiplier calculations, add pricing strategy configuration per listing, create cost estimation endpoint, build real-time pricing updates.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Pricing calculation algorithm implemented
- Per-listing pricing strategies configurable
- Cost estimation endpoint functional
- Real-time price updates working
- Unit tests for pricing accuracy passing

## Technical Details
- Create pricing module in marketplace service
- Support multiple pricing strategies (fixed, percentage markup, etc.)
- Cache pricing calculations for performance

## Dependencies
- **Task 002** (needs database layer)

## Effort Estimate
**M (Medium)** - 24 hours

## Parallel Development
Can be developed in parallel with Task 002, but conflicts with Task 003 (both modify marketplace service).
