# Task 3.4: Capacity Tracking System

## Description
Implement usage monitoring per API key, add daily/monthly limit enforcement, create capacity status tracking, build automatic key deactivation on limit.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Usage monitoring system operational
- Daily/monthly limits enforced
- Capacity status tracked in real-time
- Automatic deactivation on limit working
- Load tests for concurrent tracking passing

## Technical Details
- Add usage_count fields to database
- Implement atomic increment operations
- Create scheduled job for limit resets

## Dependencies
- **Task 002** (needs database layer)

## Effort Estimate
**M (Medium)** - 32 hours

## Parallel Development
Can be developed in parallel with Task 002, but conflicts with Task 003 (both modify database schema and marketplace service).
