# Task 3.5: Intelligent Request Routing

## Description
Build routing algorithm for key selection, implement failover to alternative keys, add load balancing across available keys, create routing metrics and logging.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Routing algorithm selects optimal keys
- Failover mechanism working
- Load balancing functional
- Routing metrics collected
- Integration tests for routing scenarios passing

## Technical Details
- Extend src/client/ with marketplace routing
- Implement circuit breaker pattern
- Add provider availability checks

## Dependencies
- **Tasks 002, 003, 004, 005** (needs all marketplace components)

## Effort Estimate
**L (Large)** - 48 hours

## Parallel Development
Must wait for all previous marketplace tasks (002, 003, 004, 005) to complete.
