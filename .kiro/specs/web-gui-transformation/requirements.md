# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the transformation of the existing aichat CLI tool into a comprehensive web-based graphical environment. The project will leverage aichat's existing multi-provider AI capabilities, local server infrastructure, and core features while adding a modern web interface, API key marketplace, document processing, cloud integrations, and peer-to-peer billing system. The goal is to create an all-in-one AI chat platform that maintains the power of the CLI tool while providing an accessible web interface with advanced marketplace and collaboration features.

## Requirements

2. WHEN a user connects cloud storage THEN the system SHALL integrate with Google Drive and OneDrive APIs
3. WHEN a document is processed THEN the system SHALL extract text content and make it available for AI context
4. WHEN a user asks questions about documents THEN the system SHALL provide contextually relevant answers based on document content
5. IF a document is too large THEN the system SHALL chunk the content appropriately for AI processing

### Requirement 6: Web Search Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want AI responses to include current web information, so that I can get up-to-date answers that go beyond the AI model's training data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enables web search THEN the system SHALL integrate DuckDuckGo API for free searches
2. WHEN a user provides Google Search API key THEN the system SHALL offer premium search capabilities
3. WHEN AI needs current information THEN the system SHALL automatically perform relevant web searches
4. WHEN search results are used THEN the system SHALL provide proper citations and source links
5. IF search APIs are unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to model-only responses

### Requirement 7: Billing and Payment System

**User Story:** As a marketplace participant, I want secure peer-to-peer payments for API usage, so that I can buy and sell API access with confidence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user makes a payment THEN the system SHALL process transactions securely through Stripe
2. WHEN API usage occurs THEN the system SHALL deduct costs from user balance in real-time
3. WHEN a user earns from API sharing THEN the system SHALL credit their account minus platform fees
4. WHEN a user requests payout THEN the system SHALL transfer earnings to their connected payment method
5. IF payment fails THEN the system SHALL suspend API access and notify the user with clear resolution steps

### Requirement 8: Analytics and Reporting

**User Story:** As a user, I want detailed analytics about my AI usage and costs, so that I can optimize my spending and understand my usage patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria
